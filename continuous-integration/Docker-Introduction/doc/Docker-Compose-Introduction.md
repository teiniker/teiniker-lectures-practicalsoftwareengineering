# Docker-Compose
Compose is a tool for defining, launching, and managing services, where service is defined as one or more replicas of a 
Docker container.
Services and systems of services are defined in *YAML* files (docker-compose.yml) and managed with the command-line 
program docker-compose.

Compose lets you stop focusing on individual containers and instead describe full environments and service component 
interactions.
